Introduction
Welcome to the Smart House Data Pack Analysis repository! This project explores IoT sensor data from smart homes to gain insights into environmental metrics like temperature, humidity, air quality, and energy consumption. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project demonstrates how IoT data can optimize smart living for comfort, efficiency, and sustainability.

Features
Custom CNN and LSTM Models: Analyze and forecast environmental metrics.
ARIMA Baseline Model: Establish foundational predictions with traditional time series methods.
Interactive Dashboard: Visualize real-time and historical trends with Tableau Public.
Comprehensive Documentation: Learn how to replicate and extend the project.
Getting Started
Dataset Overview
The Smart House Data Pack includes:

Variables: Temperature, humidity, air quality (PM2.5), energy usage, and solar radiation.
Observations: Multivariate time series data spanning multiple homes and timeframes.
Format: CSV files.
